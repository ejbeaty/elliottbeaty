<p>I&rsquo;m an IT professional that has spent his career building N-tier systems for Fortune 500s. I&rsquo;ve led and been an individual contributor on projects ranging from $20k to $4MM in budget. I love variety and I love ambiguous problems.<br />
<br/>
I devour new technologies and have dabbled in everything from RPG to Raspberry Pi automation. The .NET stack is my towering pillar of strength but I love to leverage open source technologies when they&rsquo;re a better fit for the job.<br />
<br/>
I have deep experience in the entire SDLC and have held developer, analyst, and project manager roles throughout my career.</p>
